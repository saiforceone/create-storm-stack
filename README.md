# F.T.L Stack CLI (WIP)

CLI to scaffold Flask-Based fullstack web applications

## Requirements

* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
* [NodeJs 18.x](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)  (refer to changes to Python's handling of modules)

## Things to keep in mind

- This is an early version of the CLI and things won't be exciting yet
- Some things might not work properly with later versions or Python
