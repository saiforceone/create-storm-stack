# S.T.ðŸŒ€.R.M Stack CLI (Nowhere near ready yet)

Introducing the S.T.ðŸŒ€.R.M Stack, the easiest way to create modern fullstack web application.
We believe that using S.T.ðŸŒ€.R.M will be a breeze ðŸ™ƒ

## Requirements

* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
* [NodeJs 18.x](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)  (refer to changes to Python's handling of modules or just install it with Homebrew)

## The Main Stack

- Starlette (Web Framework)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling)
- Reactive UI (Vite)
- MongoDB (Database)

## Things to keep in mind

- This is an early version of the CLI and things won't be exciting yet
- Some things might not work properly with later versions or Python
